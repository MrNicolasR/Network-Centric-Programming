// Program P05 

// In this tarball you will find the following:
        - data_1MB.txt (testfile)
        - data_10MB.txt (testfile)
        - Makefile
        - p05.c (source code)
        - README.txt (README file)
        - Reflexion.pdf (Compare both program times)
        - test.sh (Test Program)

// Function P1 

// To run:

        ./p05 {filename} param1 param2 etc.


// Detail:
The funtion accepts two parameters filename and substring.
Opens file and scans the file into a buffer to then be processed by 
the algorithm. The result is an integer corresponding to the number of 
times the substring was found in the string.


// Function param2


// To run:

        ./po5 -CH {filename} param1 param2 etc.

// Detail:
The funtion accepts two parameters filename and substring.
Opens file and scans each character at a time to then be processed by 
the algorithm. The result is an integer corresponding to the number of 
times the substring was found in the string.
