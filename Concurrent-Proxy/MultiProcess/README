// Run
    - Step 1:
        - use the make command
    - Step 2:
        - Once the program compiles run the following command
        -           proxy <port_number>



// Testing
    - To test the program I opened two seprete browsers on my computer (Chrome & Safari)
    - I opened random websites such as yahoo.com/news on both browsers
    - I checked the proxy file to make sure that the program was logging correctly
    - I also checked to see what the server was sending back



// Implementation
    - Although my previous program ran as intended the professor posted her version of the program. 
    I realized there were something missing so I decided to use her version of the program and made the
    nessacry changes to make sure the program allows multiple client's to connect to the server at the same
    time using in this case seperate process.
